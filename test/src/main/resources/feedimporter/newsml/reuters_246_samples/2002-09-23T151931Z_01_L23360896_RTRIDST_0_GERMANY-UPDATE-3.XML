                                <p> (adds departure of minister over Hitler remarks, detail)</p>
                                <p> By David Crossland</p>
                                <p> BERLIN, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Germany faced the prospect of  economic stagnation on Monday after Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder  won Sunday's election with a reduced majority that narrowed his  scope to implement painful reforms.</p>
                                <p> Schroeder said he would immediately start talks with the  environmentalist Greens to resume the coalition that has ruled  Germany for the past four years, as share prices across Europe  fell amid disappointment about the election outcome.</p>
                                <p> After making criticism of the United States and its threat  to attack Iraq a plank of his campaign, Schroeder made a first  step towards mending fences by announcing the resignation of a  minister who had been quoted as likening the methods of U.S.  President George W. Bush to Hitler's.</p>
                                <p> The controversy had distracted voters from Schroeder's  failure significantly to cut Germany's four million unemployed.</p>
                                <p> But with his majority halved, analysts said there was little  sense that Schroeder would now be able to overhaul the world's  third largest economy, which many economists say is highly  taxed, over-regulated and risks becoming as stagnant as Japan's.</p>
                                <p> His centre-left Social Democrats and the Greens got a  majority of just nine over the combined opposition, down from  21, in one of the narrowest votes in post-war history.</p>
                                <p> SPD officials said they expected to strike a new coalition  deal in the next three weeks, and that its first task would be  to drive forward planned labour market reforms.</p>
                                <p> "We can't afford to take any time off," said Schroeder, who  dramatically overhauled his conservative rival Edmund Stoiber in  the last weeks of the race.</p>
                                <p> But he faces an upper house of parliament, the Bundesrat,  dominated by opposition parties intent on thwarting the  government that narrowly robbed them of victory.</p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p> VESTED INTERESTS</p>
                                <p> He also faces powerful vested interests in the trade unions  and industry lobby groups, and has been elected by a population  used to prosperity and unwilling to stomach radical reform.</p>
                                <p> "The country remains ungovernable because it is impossible  to tackle its economic problems," said Karl-Heinz Nassmacher,  political scientist at Oldenburg University. "What we need is a  German Margaret Thatcher, but where are we going to find her?"</p>
                                <p> For now, Schroeder may continue to earn voter support from  criticism of the United States, playing to the pacifist streak  Germany has inherited from its violent history.</p>
                                <p> Even as he was announcing the departure of justice minister  Herta Daeubler-Gmelin, whose reported comments outraged  Washington, he insisted on his right to differences of opinion:</p>
                                <p> "Between friends, there can be factual differences but they  should not be personalised, particularly between close allies."</p>
                                <p> The United States showed no inclination to bury the hatchet.</p>
                                <p> U.S. Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said he would not be  meeting German Defence Minister Peter Struck at a NATO meeting  in Warsaw, reiterating Washington's line that German criticism  of U.S. foreign policy during the campaign had poisoned ties.</p>
                                <p> Schroeder's Red-Green alliance secured 306 of the 603 seats  in parliament.</p>
                                <p> While Schroeder's SPD fell 2.4 points from the previous  election in 1998 to 38.5 percent, the coalition's majority was  rescued by a best-ever performance from the Greens.</p>
                                <p> The ecologists scored 8.6 percent, boosted by the popularity  of Joschka Fischer, their foreign minister, as well as  environmental fears after devastating floods in east Germany.</p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p> STICKING POINTS</p>
                                <p> Fischer said the Greens would not "flex their muscles" in  coalition talks. But sticking points could emerge, such as SPD  opposition to further so-called "eco tax" fuel tax increases, a  pet project of the Greens and deeply unpopular with business.</p>
                                <p> The Greens have also called for a re-introduction of capital  gains tax on companies' sales of share stakes. The SPD wants  these to remain tax-free to help unravel Germany's complex web  of cross-shareholdings among companies.</p>
                                <p> Stoiber's conservatives rose 3.5 percent from 1998 to 38.5  percent. But their prospects of forming a coalition were undone  by the liberal tax-cutting Free Democrats (FDP), for decades the  kingmakers of German politics, who fell far short of  expectations with just 7.4 percent.</p>
                                <p> Deputy party head Juergen Moellemann, who derailed the FDP  campaign with criticism of Israel that triggered allegations of  anti-Semitism, resigned.</p>
                                <p> Germany now faces a winter of weakening economic growth,  seen below 0.75 percent, and of wrangling with Brussels over a  budget deficit expected to exceed the European Union's ceiling.</p>
                                <p> "The next government is going to have a very, very slim  majority and that will inhibit any kind of change," CSFB chief  European economist Julian Callow said.</p>
                                <p> Financial markets had hoped for a conservative-liberal  coalition, seen as more likely to cut taxes and implement  business-friendly policies, although neither Schroeder nor  Stoiber had dared to pledge deep cuts in the welfare system.</p>
                                <p> Despite its wealth, world-leading infrastructure and mighty  industry, which churns out two billion euros' worth of goods  daily, Germany cannot sustain its way of life because it is  ageing too fast and growing too slowly to pay for its generous  welfare and health care systems, economists say.</p>
                                <p> Stoiber said Schroeder's majority was so weak that it would  not survive its four-year term.</p>
                                <p> But in a sign that Stoiber, 60, will not get a second chance  to rule Germany, Christian Democrat leader Angela Merkel, who  stepped aside to let him fight Schroeder, took over the powerful  position of conservative parliamentary leader on Monday.</p>
                                <p> The move puts her in a strong position to become  conservative champion at the next election.    </p>
