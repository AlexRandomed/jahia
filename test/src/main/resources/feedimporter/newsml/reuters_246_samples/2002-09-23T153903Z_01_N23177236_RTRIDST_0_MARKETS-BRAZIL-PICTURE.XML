                                <p> By Todd Benson</p>
                                <p> SAO PAULO, Brazil, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Brazil's embattled  financial markets took a pounding early on Monday after a fresh  opinion poll over the weekend stoked investors' fears that a  leftist may be elected president within two weeks' time.</p>
                                <p> The country's currency, the real, sank 4.2 percent to 3.555  per dollar in thin but volatile trade, slipping below its  lowest ever closing level of 3.47, and nearing its historic  intraday low of 3.605, both set on July 31. The beleaguered  real has now shed nearly 35 percent of its value against the  greenback so far in 2002.</p>
                                <p> Stocks also fell sharply early on Monday, with the Sao  Paulo Stock Exchange's benchmark Bovespa index plunging 4.17  percent to 9,186.03 points, dragged down by hefty losses across  the boards. The stock market has fallen 32 percent so far this  year.</p>
                                <p>  "From the market's point of view, the Datafolha poll over  the weekend confirmed the worst possible scenario," said Sergio  Machado, treasury director at Banco Fator in Sao Paulo.</p>
                                <p> The poll, released late Saturday, showed the left-wing  front-runner Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva extending his lead to 25  percentage points over market favorite Jose Serra, a distant  No. 2 in the polls. The results fueled speculation that the  Workers' Party candidate may be on track to winning the  election in one round of voting on Oct. 6.</p>
                                <p> If no candidate garners the sum of the other contenders'  votes plus one on Oct. 6, the top two vote-getters go into  runoff Oct. 27.</p>
                                <p> Lula, a former union leader making his fourth bid for the  presidency, saw his support among voters surge 4 percentage  points to 44 percent in the Datafolha poll, while Serra, the  candidate supported by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's  ruling coalition, slipped to 19 percent from 21 percent.</p>
                                <p> The survey also showed former Rio de Janeiro state Gov.  Anthony Garotinho, who defines himself to the left of Lula,  edging up 1 point to 15 percent, leaving him within striking  distance of Serra.</p>
                                <p> "Lula on the rise, Serra falling and Garotinho climbing is  the last thing markets want," said Machado.</p>
                                <p> Though Lula has toned down his past socialist rhetoric and  pledged to pursue fiscal austerity and sound macroeconomic  policies, investors fear the former metalworker could face  difficulties managing Latin America's largest economy and its  burgeoning $260 billion public debt.</p>
                                <p> Instead they prefer Serra, whom they see as the most likely  candidate to forge ahead with the market-friendly reforms of  the Cardoso era.</p>
                                <p> On Friday, Brazil's markets broke a week-long losing streak  after a separate poll by the Ibope Institute showed Lula  falling slightly to 39 percent of voters' support, raising  hopes that Serra can force a run-off ballot on Oct. 27.</p>
                                <p> STOCKS SLUMP</p>
                                <p> The poll jitters, coupled with slumping share prices on  Wall Street, were also taking their toll on Brazil's stock  market on Monday, traders said.</p>
                                <p> Among the day's most active stocks was market bellwether  Tele Norte Leste Participacoes, or Telemar, whose shares  tumbled 4.53 percent to 23.20 reais. Telemar stock accounts for  about 14 percent of the Bovespa index.</p>
                                <p> Another actively traded stock taking a hit was state-owned  oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro, or Petrobras, whose shares fell  4.58 percent to 41.70 reais.</p>
                                <p> One of the few standouts on the upside was paper and pulp  company Aracruz Celulose SA, whose stock price rose 2.6 percent  to 5.53 reais. As a major exporter, Aracruz shares tend to get  a lift from a weaker local currency.</p>
                                <p> With a Lula victory appearing increasingly likely,  investors said markets were beginning to look for signs of who  would take the reins of Brazil's economy in a Workers' Party  administration.</p>
                                <p> "Now people are itching to know who would make up Lula's  economic team to see if their market credentials are credible  or not," said Pedro Thomazoni, treasury director at Lloyds TSB  in Sao Paulo. "Until that happens, markets are going to remain  under pressure."  </p>
