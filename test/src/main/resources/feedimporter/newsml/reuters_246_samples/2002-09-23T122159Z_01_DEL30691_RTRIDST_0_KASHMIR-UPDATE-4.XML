                                <p> By Sanjeev Miglani and Sheikh Mushtaq</p>
                                <p> SRINAGAR, India, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Militants launched a  string of attacks on security forces and political workers in  Indian Kashmir on Monday as violence flared on the eve of a  second round of a state assembly election, police said.</p>
                                <p> The attacks wounded 12 people and followed a gun battle  between Indian forces and Muslim militants in which four rebels  were killed, police said.</p>
                                <p> Five soldiers guarding a polling station in the state's  summer capital, Srinagar, were wounded when militants attacked  with grenades, a police spokesman said. Another security man  was hurt in a grenade blast in another part of the city.</p>
                                <p> Six civilians were wounded in a separate attack when rebels  threw a grenade at political party campaign workers.</p>
                                <p> Srinagar, along with the state's winter capital Jammu, will  go to the polls on Tuesday to elect a state parliament for  Indian Kashmir, which is at the heart of a nine-month military  standoff between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan.</p>
                                <p> Rebels have threatened to kill anyone involved in the  election and separatist political groups say the vote is no  substitute for a U.N.-supervised plebiscite to decide if the  Himalayan region should be part of India or Pakistan.</p>
                                <p> More than 35,000 people have been killed in the  13-year-revolt against Indian rule in the Muslim-majority  region.</p>
                                <p> India is hoping the election, which is being staggered over  more than three weeks to help security forces trying to ensure  a peaceful vote, will boost the legitimacy of its rule and  weaken the insurgency.</p>
                                <p> The first of four rounds of voting was held last week and  the the last round will be on October 8.</p>
                                <p> More than 470 people, including a state minister and about  30 political workers, have been killed since the elections were  called on August 2.</p>
                                <p> "UNPRECEDENTED INTIMIDATION"</p>
                                <p> Thousands of soldiers have been deployed in Srinagar, Jammu  and Budgam, the three districts that will vote on Tuesday,  officials said.</p>
                                <p> "Even though the threat of intimidation is unprecedented,  our preparedness is also unprecedented," said chief electoral  officer Pramod Jain.</p>
                                <p> The Greater Kashmir newspaper quoted the Hizbul-Mujahideen  guerrilla group as saying it had ordered members to attack  polling stations. The pro-Pakistan group warned government  employees and voters to stay away from polling stations.</p>
                                <p> "We have formed squads and directed them to attack all  polling booths. Hence, government employees and the general  public are warned to keep away from these places," the group  was quoted as saying.</p>
                                <p> Militants threw a grenade at a car carrying workers of a  pro-India party in the Awantipora area of southern Kashmir. The  grenade missed its target and wounded six bystanders, police  said.</p>
                                <p> The People's Democratic Party was campaigning in the  Awantipora area which will vote on October 1 in the third phase  of the election.</p>
                                <p> Earlier, security forces gunned down four rebels near  Banihal town in southern Jammu and Kashmir state.</p>
                                <p> "The four separatists were killed on Monday in the gun  battle which has been going on since last night and is still  happening," a police official told Reuters. He had no further  details.</p>
                                <p> The Banihal area will vote on October 8 in the final phase  of the election.</p>
                                <p> BOYCOTT CALL</p>
                                <p> In other violence on Monday, a soldier on patrol was killed  and a soldier and a civilian wounded when militants triggered  an explosion in Udhampur district in southern Kashmir, police  said.</p>
                                <p> Security forces killed a militant on Sunday, ending a siege  at a police camp housing families of servicemen that had fanned  fears of a repeat of a deadly May raid on an army camp that  brought India and Pakistan close to war.</p>
                                <p> Two gunmen forced their way into the camp, killing a  policeman. A search was under way for a second gunman.</p>
                                <p> India sees the level of violence during the elections as a  crucial test of Pakistan's pledge to stop militants crossing  into Indian Kashmir.</p>
                                <p> Pakistan rejects the poll as a farce and wants Kashmiris to  vote on whether they want to stay with India or join Pakistan,  says incursions have halted except by rogue elements.</p>
                                <p> An alliance of Kashmiri separatist political groups, the  All Parties Hurriyat (Freedom) Conference, has urged a boycott  of the vote, making victory for the state's ruling National  Conference party, a pro-Delhi party, a virtual certainty.</p>
                                <p> Hurriyat has called for a general strike on Tuesday to  coincide with the second voting round. Last Monday's first  round was largely peaceful but officials have said violence  could escalate over the remaining three rounds of the  election.    </p>
