                                <p> By Denise Duclaux</p>
                                <p> NEW YORK, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Stocks are set to slump at  Monday's open as a weak forecast from fiber-optic gear maker  JDS Uniphase Corp. unnerved investors and the threat of war  drove oil prices to 19-month highs.</p>
                                <p> "The mood is very nervous," said Edgar Peters, chief  investment officer at Boston-based PanAgora Asset Management,  which manages $13 billion. "The level of uncertainty is very  high and because of that people aren't willing to buy. There's  nervousness about the political situation, the international  situation and finally the fundamental earnings outlook."</p>
                                <p> The confessional period, when companies warn earnings will  miss analysts' targets, heated up last week with dire outlooks  from giants like computer services company Electronic Data  Systems Corp. and financial leader J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co..  Former tech darling JDS Uniphase Corp. kicked off a fresh week  with another dim forecast. JDS fell to $2 on Instinet from its  $2.14 close after cutting its quarterly sales guidance.</p>
                                <p> The specter of a second Gulf War added to Wall Street's  cloud of worries. Iraq vowed on Saturday to reject any new  Security Council resolution differing from an agreement reached  with the U.N. secretary-general, while President George W. Bush  reviewed detailed military options devised by the Pentagon for  a possible attack on Iraq.</p>
                                <p> Oil prices surged with dealers pointing to Baghdad's  decision to reject any new U.N. resolution as well as Israel's  siege of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Ramallah  headquarters. Sustained tension in the Middle East, which pumps  a third of the world's crude oil, has already driven oil prices  up 50 percent this year.</p>
                                <p> Equity futures pointed to a drop at the open. December  futures for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 6.60 points to  835.60. Dow Jones Industrial futures sagged 64 points to 7,881,  while Nasdaq 100 futures lost 2 points to 873.50.</p>
                                <p> European shares were broadly lower as disappointment about  the result of the German election added to the already gloomy  tone set by worries about the global economy and corporate  profits.</p>
                                <p> Frankfurt's DAX index was down 3.56 percent, a day after  German voters returned the incumbent government to power with a  sharply reduced majority.</p>
                                <p> The FTSE Eurotop 300 index of pan-European blue chips was  down 1.87 percent, while the narrower DJ Euro Stoxx 50 index  was off 2.52 percent at 2,260.</p>
                                <p> Asia's share markets skidded on Monday as war fever drove  oil prices higher. Tokyo was closed for its autumn equinox  holiday</p>
                                <p> With little economic news on the calendar, investors will  be eyeing corporate news throughout the day.</p>
                                <p> Troubled software maker Peregrine Systems Inc. on Sunday  said it filed for bankruptcy protection and that it plans to  sell its coveted Remedy unit to BMC Software Inc. for $350  million in cash -- less than a third the price Peregrine paid  for it.</p>
                                <p> R.H. Donnelley Corp., a yellow page marketing company  widely acknowledged to have published the first U.S. telephone  directory, returned to its roots on Sunday by agreeing to  purchase Sprint Corp.'s phone book business for $2.23 billion  in cash.</p>
                                <p> Qwest Communications International Inc., a local U.S.  telephone company facing federal probes of its accounting  practices, said on Sunday it expected to restate $950 million  in revenues and costs for swaps of optical-network capacity.</p>
                                <p> On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve's policy-setting will grab  the spotlight. The Fed is expected to keep interest rates  steady after its meeting. Not one of the 22 primary dealers who  trade directly with the Fed think it will alter interest rates  at its Sept. 24 meeting. Still, analysts anticipate the Fed  will keep its risk assessment weighted toward economic  weakness.</p>
                                <p> Stocks inched out of a three-day losing streak on Friday  after Qualcomm Inc. said it will ship more cellular-phone  chips. But key indexes logged their fourth negative week in a  row after a slew of profit warnings.</p>
                                <p> The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average was up 43.63  points, or 0.55 percent, at 7,986.02. The broader Standard &amp;  Poor's 500 Index was up 2.07 points, or 0.25 percent, at  845.39. The technology-laced Nasdaq Composite Index was up 4.64  points, or 0.38 percent, at 1,221.09.</p>
                                <p> During one of the busiest weeks of the so-called warnings  season, the Dow average slipped 3.9 percent, the Nasdaq slid  5.5 percent and the S&amp;P dropped 5 percent.</p>
                                <p>  Support -- where buyers are expected to swoop in -- is at  1,192 for the Nasdaq, 7,800 for the Dow and 833 for the S&amp;P  500, according to research firm Schaeffer's Investment  Research. Resistance -- the point where sellers are likely to  emerge -- is at 1,250 for the Nasdaq, 8,200 for the Dow and 870  for the S&amp;P. The levels are key elements of technical analysis,  which studies prices, volume and charts.    </p>
