                                <p> By Brian Homewood</p>
                                <p> RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Chile's championship got  back to normal at the weekend after players ended a three-week  long strike which had forced two rounds of matches to be  postponed and youth teams to be fielded last week.</p>
                                <p> Colombia's veteran goalkeeper Rene Higuita was given a  rapturous reception by fans of his former club Atletico Nacional  as he returned to his old hunting ground with Pereira, the team  where he is making his latest comeback attempt.</p>
                                <p> Argentine strikers continued to knock in the goals around  the continent. Luis Bonnet was on target for Sporting Cristal in  Peru, where he is leading scorer, and Cristian Carnero added two  more to his tally in Ecuador, helping championship leaders  Deportivo Quito keep their unbeaten record.</p>
                                <p> There was no football at the weekend in Uruguay or Paraguay,  where the championships took a break.</p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p> CHILE</p>
                                <p> Chile's players returned to action at the weekend after  calling off a 23-day long strike, in which they protested over  unpaid wages and demanded a greater say in the administration of  the sport.</p>
                                <p> The stoppage caused two weekends of football to be  postponed, while last weekend's matches went ahead with youth  teams. Despite protests from the professional players, the  results of last weekend's matches have stood.</p>
                                <p> Cobreloa maintained a 100 percent record in the Clausura  championship by hammering Santiago Morning 4-0 away. Uruguayan  Osvaldo Canobbio and Jose Luis Diaz put Cobreloa two goals ahead  in a quarter of an hour, then Mauricio Dinamarca and Ruben  Castillo added two more in the last 30 minutes.</p>
                                <p> The team from the copper mining town of Calama, who have  enjoyed a new lease of life under former Chile coach Nelson  Acosta, have 18 points from six games.</p>
                                <p> Colo Colo, declared bankrupt at the start of the year, came  from behind to beat Audax Italiano 2-1.</p>
                                <p> Luis Ignacio Quinteros and Manuel Neira scored after Felipe  Gonzalez had fired the visitors ahead with a free kick.</p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p> COLOMBIA</p>
                                <p> Veteran goalkeeper Rene Higuita, who is making his latest  comeback attempt with Pereira, was given a rapturous welcome by  fans of Atletico Nacional, the club where he spent most of his  career.</p>
                                <p> Higuita made several saves as Pereira, one from bottom in  the 18-team championship, battled for a 2-2 draw against one of  the title contenders.</p>
                                <p> Afterwards, the Pereira changing-room was mobbed with  admirers trying to catch a glimpse of the charismatic  36-year-old, famous for his forays upfield and eccentricities  such as the "scorpion kick" save he made against England in a  friendly at Wembley.</p>
                                <p> "I'm happy to be doing what I enjoy most, which is to play  football," he said.</p>
                                <p> Thirteen-times champions Millonarios were beaten 3-2 by  Santa Fe in a thrilling Bogota derby, a result which left them  bottom of the table. They have not won in their last nine  matches.</p>
                                <p> Aldo Ramirez gave Santa Fe a 2-0 lead with two long-range  efforts and Lucas Jaramillo made it 3-0 with 15 minutes to go.  Millonarios battled back through Alexander Lemus and Omar Guerra  in a thrilling finale which ended with all 22 players in the  Santa Fe end of the field.</p>
                                <p> Oscar Quintabina gave leaders Deportivo Cali a 1-0 win away  to relegation-threatened Real Cartagena and surprise package  Pasto stayed second by winning 2-0 at Tolima.</p>
                                <p> Pablo Jaramillo opened the scoring after 40 seconds and  Jairo Patino's penalty made sure of three points.</p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p> BOLIVIA</p>
                                <p> Blooming, coached by former Argentina international defender  Jose Luis Brown who scored in the 1986 World Cup final, kept  their lead in the second stage (Clausura) with a 3-1 win over  struggling Mariscal Braun.</p>
                                <p> Brazilian Clemilson da Silva gave the visitors a surprise  first-half lead but Blooming hit back with three goals in nine  minutes after the break -- two from Marcelo Ceballos and one  from Raul Gutierrez.</p>
                                <p> Second-placed Bolivar did not play and dropped four points  behind but have two games in hand.</p>
                                <p> They were caught by Real Potosi, who came from two goals  behind to beat The Strongest 3-2 with Sandro Lopez scoring twice  in the last seven minutes.</p>
                                <p> The match was played at over 4,000 metres above sea level in  the historic silver mining town of Potosi.</p>
                                <p> Teenage striker Jose Alfredo Castillo scored his 31st goal  of the season to give defending champions Oriente Petrolero a  1-0 win away to Independiente Petrolero in Sucre. But Oriente  remained seven points behind Blooming in seventh place.</p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p> PERU</p>
                                <p> Argentine Luis Bonnet continued his prolific goalscoring  form, hitting the target again in Sporting Cristal's 3-0 win  over bottom-of-the-table Juan Aurich.</p>
                                <p> Brazilian defender Denis and striker Sergio Junior were the  other scores for the Brewers, who extended their lead in the  second stage of the championship to seven points.</p>
                                <p> Bonnet has scored 11 goals in as many games in the second  stage and 21 in the whole season.</p>
                                <p> Alianza Lima and Alianza Atletico, two of the chasing teams,  spoiled each other's chances of catching Sporting by drawing  2-2. It was the first meeting of the pair since a match in July  when the teams refused to take doping tests and each had three  points deducted.</p>
                                <p> Sergio Ibarra, another Argentine, scored a late equaliser  for Alianza Atletico after two goals in four minutes from  Cristian Garcia and Johan Fano had put Lima ahead. Roberto  Garcia had opened the scoring in the first half.</p>
                                <p> Universitario, who won the first stage but then had to  disband their team because of financial difficulties, continued  their miserable run, losing 1-0 to Melgar who had not previously  won in the second stage. Mexican Roberto Clemente scored the  winner for the team from Arequipa.</p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p> ECUADOR</p>
                                <p> Deportivo Quito stayed unbeaten after 15 games in the  championship's second stage but threw away a two-goal lead in  their 2-2 draw away to struggling police club Espoli.</p>
                                <p> Argentine Cristian Carnero, who took his tally to 18 and is  the competition's leading scorer, put Deportivo in control as he  scored twice. He missed a penalty in between.</p>
                                <p> But the home team hit back in the last 20 minutes with two  goals by Claudio Demaria, the second another penalty.</p>
                                <p> Deportivo lead the second stage, four points ahead of  second-placed El Nacional who missed a chance to close the gap  when they were held 1-1 at home by Aucas.</p>
                                <p> Defending champions Emelec continued their revival under new  coach Rodolfo Motta.</p>
                                <p> The Electrics beat Liga de Quito 3-1 with goals by defender  Augusto Poroso and midfielders Otilino Tenorio and Moises Cuero  and climbed to sixth.</p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p> VENEZUELA</p>
                                <p> Caracas FC stayed top of the Apertura, the first stage of  the championship, with a 1-0 win over Nacional Tachira, last  season's champions. David McInitosh scored the only goal in the  second half.</p>
                                <p> Argentine striker Matias Milozzi, the championship's top  scorer, struck his seventh goal in as many games for Trujillanos  but his side still lost 2-1 to Deportivo Tachira, who went  second.</p>
                                <p> Didier Sanabria and Jose Felix Gutierrez scored for  Deportivo.</p>
