                                <p> Germany faces reform gridlock after election</p>
                                <p> BERLIN - Germany faced the prospect of continued economic  stagnation on Monday after Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder won  Sunday's election with a reduced majority that narrowed his  scope to implement painful reforms.</p>
                                <p> Schroeder's centre-left government of Social Democrats and  Greens got a majority of just nine over the combined opposition  parties, down from 21 at the last election.</p>

                                <p> LONDON - War fever drove U.S. oil prices to a new 19-month  high on Monday as dealers took fright at the growing threat of a  U.S. assault on Iraq.</p>
                                <p> Benchmark U.S. crude oil jumped 41 cents to $30.25 a barrel  by late morning in London, after setting a high of $30.48, its  highest level since February last year.</p>

                                <p> Italian jobless rate dips to near 10-yr low</p>
                                <p> ROME - Italian unemployment slipped in July to its lowest  level in almost 10 years, national statistics agency ISTAT said  on Monday, providing a rare ray of light for the government in  an otherwise murky economic landscape.</p>
                                <p> The seasonally adjusted jobless rate in the euro zone's  third-largest economy was 9.0 percent in July from 9.1 percent  in April, ISTAT said in its quarterly unemployment report.</p>

                                <p> HONG KONG - Consumer prices in Hong Kong fell 3.3 percent  year-on-year in August, extending the territory's deflationary  trend to a 46th straight month and reflecting stubborn weakness  in what was once one of the world's most vibrant economies.</p>
                                <p> The fall in the composite consumer price index was  marginally worse than market forecasts for a 3.2 percent slide.</p>

                                <p> The transactions in question include the exchange of optical  capacity with other carriers, it said.</p>

Donnelley Corp., a yellow page marketing  company widely acknowledged to have published the first U.S.  telephone directory, returned to its roots on Sunday by agreeing  to purchase Sprint Corp.'s phone book business for $2.23 billion  in cash.</p>
                                <p> The transaction will create the largest publicly traded  phone book publisher, with more than 260 white and yellow page  directories distributed to 18 million customers in 18 states.</p>

                                <p> Dole CEO makes $1.3 bln offer for rest of company</p>

                                <p> David Murdock, Dole's billionaire chairman and chief  executive, presented a proposal to the company's board Sunday to  purchase the 76 percent stake he and his family do not already  own for $29.50 per share, he said in a statement</p>

                                <p> Taiwan keeps rates steady, but may cut later</p>
                                <p> TAIPEI - Taiwan's central bank left rates unchanged as  expected at its quarterly policy meeting on Monday, as the  export-reliant economy warms up during the annual manufacturing  peak in the second half.</p>
                                <p> However, a faltering recovery in the United States -- which  absorbs about 30 percent of all Taiwan exports -- could lead the  Federal Reserve to trim rates later this year, prompting similar  cuts in Taiwan and other Asian peers, said economists.</p>

                                <p> German vote weighs on stocks, boost bonds</p>
                                <p> LONDON - Investors dumped stocks and headed for safe haven  government bonds on Monday as German Chancellor Gerhard  Schroeder's narrow election victory was seen heralding a period  of sluggish growth and delays to reforms in Europe's biggest  economy.</p>
                                <p> Fears of war in the Middle East drove oil prices to  year-highs, boosting oil company shares, and propelled gold  prices higher in Europe. Currency markets showed little  immediate reaction to the German elections.</p>
