                                <p> BERLIN - German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder faces the task  of reforming Europe's largest economy with a sharply reduced  majority after he and his Greens coalition partners narrowly won  Sunday's general election.</p>
                                <p> "We have difficult times ahead," a visibly merry Schroeder  called to his jubilant Social Democrat (SPD) supporters after  voters cut his majority over the combined opposition parties to  nine from 21 at the last election.</p>

                                <p> RAMALLAH, West Bank - Israeli troops pressed on with their  siege of Yasser Arafat's West Bank headquarters after halting  demolition of his presidential complex following U.S. criticism.</p>
                                <p> Troops stood guard in the levelled compound where only one  main building remains standing, sheltering the Palestinian  president and up to 250 others.</p>

                                <p> BOUAKE, Ivory Coast - French troops rumbled north to  evacuate Westerners trapped by fighting in Ivory Coast as  skirmishes flared on the outskirts of a city where dozens of  American children are hiding.</p>
                                <p> Rebel soldiers said they had beaten off a heavy attack on  the city of Bouake by loyalist troops sent to crush an uprising  that has plunged the West African country into its worst crisis  since independence from France in 1960.</p>

                                <p> BAGHDAD - Iraq denounced as "wicked" U.S. attempts at the  United Nations to adopt a tough resolution on Iraq's  disarmament, saying Washington was seeking U.N. cover for any  military action.</p>
                                <p> "These American attempts to issue a new (U.N.) resolution  have bad intentions and wicked aims," said al-Thawra newspaper,  mouthpiece of the ruling Baath Party.</p>

                                <p> SRINAGAR, India - Violence flared ahead of the second round  of Indian Kashmir's state elections that Islamic militants have  vowed to sabotage, as security forces gunned down four rebels,  police said.</p>
                                <p> "The four separatists were killed on Monday in the gun  battle which has been going on since last night and is still  happening," a police official told Reuters. </p>

                                <p> MERIDA, Mexico - Hurricane Isidore ploughed across Mexico's  Yucatan peninsula, forcing thousands from their homes as it  flooded streets, toppled trees and power lines and shut down  offshore oil rigs.</p>
                                <p> About 70,000 people in low-lying fishing villages on the  peninsula were evacuated to shelters after torrential rains  flooded homes and roads, and winds of more than 120 mph (195  kph) ripped off roofs and uprooted trees.</p>

                                <p> MADRID - Spain denied Moroccan claims that a Spanish  military helicopter had landed on a disputed Mediterranean islet  and said it regretted Rabat's cancellation of talks planned for  Monday to smooth troubled relations.</p>
                                <p> The tiny uninhabited island some 200 metres (yards) off the  Moroccan coast was the source of a conflict in July when the  Spanish military kicked off Moroccan troops at gunpoint.</p>

                                <p> JAKARTA - A grenade exploded in a car outside a U.S. embassy  warehouse in the centre of Indonesia's capital Jakarta in a  botched attack that killed one of the vehicle's occupants,  police said.</p>
                                <p> The incident came at a time of heightened security at U.S.  embassies worldwide following what Washington called credible  terrorist threats marking the anniversary of the September 11,  2001, attacks on New York and Washington.</p>

                                <p> In the first part of the largest delegation North Korea has  sent to the South, 159 athletes and team staff, as well as 14  doctors and journalists, arrived on a chartered flight in Pusan,  the venue of the September 29-October 14 games.</p>
