                                <p> By Denise Duclaux</p>
                                <p> NEW YORK, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Stocks sank in late morning  trade on Monday, tossing the Nasdaq to its lowest level since  1996, as dim outlooks from companies ranging from telecom gear  maker JDS Uniphase Corp. to retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  fanned worries over corporate health.</p>
                                <p> "We had come to a point where earnings revisions had come  down in terms of magnitude with every quarter, but now they  seem to be accelerating," said Owen Fitzpatrick, head of U.S.  equity group at Deutsche Bank Private Banking, which oversees  $7 billion.</p>
                                <p> An early stream of profit warnings is bucking a trend that  began in the fourth quarter of 2001, when more companies  offered positive outlooks and fewer offered negative ones,  according to Thomson First Call. The ratio between those two  kept improving into the second quarter of 2002, but the trend  is starting to reverse.</p>
                                <p> The threat of a second Gulf War added to Wall Street's  cloud of worries and triggered a spike in oil prices. Iraq  vowed to reject any new Security Council resolution differing  from an agreement reached with the U.N. secretary-general,  while President George W. Bush reviewed military options for a  possible attack on the oil-rich nation.</p>
                                <p> The tech-laced Nasdaq Composite Index lost 31 points, or  2.60 percent, to 1,189, on track to close below 1,200 for the  first time since since September 1996. The blue-chip Dow Jones  industrial average sank 157 points, or 1.97 percent, to 7,829,  after dropping more than 2 percent earlier. The broader  Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index fell 15 points, or 1.85 percent, to  829.</p>
                                <p> JDS, the world's top supplier of components and modules  that boost the speed and capacity of optical networks, added  its voice to the chorus of companies hurt by sharp slowdown in  the telecommunications market. JDS fell 8 cents to $2.06 after  trimming its first-quarter sales guidance.</p>
                                <p> Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, added more pressure  to the market with a $2.33 drop to $52.37. The Dow member said  it expects September sales at stores open at least a year to  come in near the low end of its growth forecast. Home  improvement retailer Home Depot Inc. fell $1.65 to $29.58,  adding more pressure to the Dow.</p>
                                <p> Tyco International Ltd. fell 81 cents to $14.15 and ranked  as the most active on the New York Stock Exchange. Though  Tyco's board has said it was unaware of extravagant pay and  loans given to top executives, minutes of the board's  compensation committee show it knew of many of the payments  months before the board took steps to disclose them, The New  York Times reported.</p>
                                <p> Microsoft Corp. fell $2.28 to $45.18 and weighed on the  Dow. Soundview Technology Group said the software giant is  expensive and it will be difficult for Microsoft to show  significant additional growth without a return in personal  computer growth and information technology spending.</p>
                                <p> Dole Food Co., the world's largest producer of fresh  fruits, emerged as a bright spot in the market with a $5.26  jump to $29.75. The company's chief executive offered to take  Dole private with a $1.26 billion cash bid.</p>
                                <p> Nucor Corp., the largest U.S. steel recycler, tumbled  $8.43, or more than 17 percent, to $40.55. The company said  third-quarter earnings would fall below previous estimates due  to weakened demand for non-residential construction activity  and higher mill start-up costs.</p>
                                <p> Semiconductor stocks dragged on the market after Credit  Suisse First Boston cut its investment outlook on 14 chip  equipment makers, including Applied Materials Inc. and  KLA-Tencor Corp., citing a dampened capital spending  environment. Applied Materials fell 31 cents to $11.62, while  KLA-Tencor dropped 66 cents to $27.36.    </p>
