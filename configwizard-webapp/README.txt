

simply do 

mvn clean install jahia:deploy

in the configwizard-webapp directory.

To try it just launch the Tomcat in the target directory under config-packaging and access 

http://localhost:8080/config

after the installation has finished, just go to 

http://localhost:8080/cms

and install a new virtual site
