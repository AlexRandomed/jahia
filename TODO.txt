TODO
----

- Fix problems with Jahia restart under Tomcat 6
- Update JARs to be in sync with Maven 1 branch
- Fix problem with context.xml file that differs between Tomcat 6 and Tomcat 5.5. For the moment only deployment on Tomcat 5.5 is supported because of this.
- Find a better way to deploy the shared libraries into Tomcat, especially in the locations that differ from one version of Tomcat to another.
- Integrate Jammer Javascript regrouping if possible (probably by using Ant scripts from Maven), or using YUI Compressor plugin.
- Reactivate JSP compilation
- Generate Jahia windows installer in "jahia-windows-package" subprojects
- Migrate Hibernate *.hbm.xml generated files to Java annotations
- Integrate ESI server source code into a sub project
- Integrate default portlets into subprojects in the portlets directory
- Fix tests and reactivate them by default
