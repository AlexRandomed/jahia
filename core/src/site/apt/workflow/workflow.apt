Workflow Integration

 Jahia's workflow service uses an external back-end, by default the jBPM workflow implementation, but that can be replaced
 by other implementations if need be. This document will therefore mostly document the default integration.

* Configuration

 The main configuration file for the workflow service is :

-------------------------
 WEB-INF/etc/spring/workflow/applicationcontext-workflow.xml
-------------------------

 The jBPM provider configuration file is the following :

-------------------------
 WEB-INF/etc/spring/workflow/applicationcontext-jBPM.xml
-------------------------

* Defining new workflows in modules

 As you can see in the jBPM configuration file, we use a wildcard classpath lookup to search for the jPDL workflow
 process definition files. This means that you can simply put in your module in the proper package (by default
 org.jahia.services.workflow) a file with the extension jpdl.xml and it will be picked-up on Jahia's startup and made
 available to use.
