# age of cookie in seconds. So basically a value of 2592000 is 30 days

# recognized using a cookie, the cookie age will be reset to the value defined
# in cookieAuthMaxAgeInSeconds. If this setting is false, cookies will not be
# renewed, and after the cookie expires the user will have to login again.

### Scheduler config  ################

### Site serverName testing config ###
# The following configuration parameters mostly concern the generation of the
# "Exit Administration" button in the administration console. The URL that is
# generated to go back to a site needs to be tested first, in order to
# determine if we should generate an URL using the site's serverName or if
# we should generate an URL using the current host name used for accessing the
# administration servlet.
#
# For example, if for a site we have :
#    serverName="this.is.an.invalid.hostname",
#    serverKey="myTestSite"
# the following parameters will determine the URL that will be tested. So
# if we have the default, Jahia will try to connect to :
#    http://this.is.an.invalid.hostname:8080/jahia/jsp/isjahia.jsp
# and use the connection timeout that we specify. If the connection fails,
# the URL generated will be :
#    http://localhost:8080/jahia/Jahia/site/myTestSite
# The localhost:8080 part may be different if this is not what we are using
# when connecting to the administration servlet. If we are connected to the
# administration servlet with :
#    http://127.0.0.1:7070/cms/administration
# then the fallback URL for the "Exit Administration" would be :
#    http://127.0.0.1:7070/cms/Jahia/site/myTestSite
#
# The siteServerNameTestURLExpr can access the following variables :
#  "request" - an HttpServletRequest object
#  "siteServerName" - a String that contains the siteServerName we want to
# test.
# Expressions always start with "${" and end with "}". The expression
# language supported is JEXL. You can find more information about JEXL
# here : http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/jexl/
# Note : you can also change the name/location of the isjahia.jsp file. The
# only thing this resource must do is set a header called "jahia-version" that
# must be present for the siteServerName to be properly identified as a Jahia
# server.
siteServerNameTestURLExpr                              = ${request.scheme}://${siteServerName}:${request.serverPort}${request.contextPath}/jsp/isjahia.jsp
# The following parameter allows for configuration of the connection timeout
# when testing with the above URL. Don't set this too high as the connection
# will be attempted everytime an "Exit Administration" button is generated.
# The timeout value is in milliseconds.
