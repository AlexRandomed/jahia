    /**
     * Called by the server (via the <code>service</code> method) to
     * allow a servlet to handle a GET request.
     * <p/>
     * <p>Overriding this method to support a GET request also
     * automatically supports an HTTP HEAD request. A HEAD
     * request is a GET request that returns no body in the
     * response, only the request header fields.
     * <p/>
     * <p>When overriding this method, read the request data,
     * write the response headers, get the response's writer or
     * output stream object, and finally, write the response data.
     * It's best to include content type and encoding. When using
     * a <code>PrintWriter</code> object to return the response,
     * set the content type before accessing the
     * <code>PrintWriter</code> object.
     * <p/>
     * <p>The servlet container must write the headers before
     * committing the response, because in HTTP the headers must be sent
     * before the response body.
     * <p/>
     * <p>Where possible, set the Content-Length header (with the
     * {@link javax.servlet.ServletResponse#setContentLength} method),
     * to allow the servlet container to use a persistent connection
     * to return its response to the client, improving performance.
     * The content length is automatically set if the entire response fits
     * inside the response buffer.
     * <p/>
     * <p>When using HTTP 1.1 chunked encoding (which means that the response
     * has a Transfer-Encoding header), do not set the Content-Length header.
     * <p/>
     * <p>The GET method should be safe, that is, without
     * any side effects for which users are held responsible.
     * For example, most form queries have no side effects.
     * If a client request is intended to change stored data,
     * the request should use some other HTTP method.
     * <p/>
     * <p>The GET method should also be idempotent, meaning
     * that it can be safely repeated. Sometimes making a
     * method safe also makes it idempotent. For example,
     * repeating queries is both safe and idempotent, but
     * buying a product online or modifying data is neither
     * safe nor idempotent.
     * <p/>
     * <p>If the request is incorrectly formatted, <code>doGet</code>
     * returns an HTTP "Bad Request" message.
     *
     * @param req  an {@link javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest} object that
     *             contains the request the client has made of the servlet
     * @param resp an {@link javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse} object that
     *             contains the response the servlet sends to the client
     * @throws java.io.IOException            if an input or output error is
     *                                        detected when the servlet handles the GET request
     * @throws javax.servlet.ServletException if the request for the GET
     *                                        could not be handled
     * @see javax.servlet.ServletResponse#setContentType
