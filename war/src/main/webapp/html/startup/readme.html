    <p>This  ReadMe covers Jahia Enterprise Edition (EE) v6.0 </p>
        <p class="style1">Jahia
delivers the first Open Source Web Content Integration Software by
combining Enterprise Web Content Management with Document Management
and Portal features. Jahia EE v6 is now fully leveraging Web 2.0 and
Ajax technologies and is leveraging the most used and state of the art
J2EE open source libraries (Spring; Lucene; Jackrabbit; Pluto;
Hibernate;…).</p>
	  <p>This major release aims to ease the life of
Jahia users and integrators while improving front-end user interfaces with the
latest in Web 2.0 technologies. Jahia EE v6 user interfaces have been
fully redesigned and improved by integrating native support for the
AJAX Google Web Toolkit (GWT) library and the rich Ext GWT components (<a href="http://www.extjs.com/products/gxt/" target="_blank">http://www.extjs.com/products/gxt/</a>).
All our front-end templating technologies have also been rewritten to
offer a cleaner integrator story (clearer separation of content
definitions and views; complete refactoring of all the old Jahia
taglibs; migration to a full CSS support; better support for skins and
themes;…) and our embedded document and portal servers were upgraded to
the latest versions of the existing standards (support for JSR170,
JSR168 and JSR 286).</p>

  </div>
    <a name="anchor_1"></a>
    <h3>Enterprise Web Content Management System</h3>
  <h4 class="subtitle"><u>For Managers:</u></h4>
  <p class="subtitle">1.	Ready-to-use starter kits</p>
  <p>Jahia
EE v6.0 now includes some ready-to-use Starter Kits. This first edition
is focusing on a demonstration package targeted to brochure-ware public
web sites. Additional “Starter Kits” will be made available during the
next months in order to significantly shorten integration time required
to go from concept to production. Such Starter Kits will focus on
different target needs (Brochure-ware Public Web Sites or Collaborative
Intranets) or on vertical industries needs (eGovernment, Education,
Insurance, Bank…).</p>
    <p>The Jahia installation process was also
improved in order to let managers directly test some pre-configured
demonstration packages. Integrators can now use this feature to provide
“pre-configured test builds” with pre-populated content to their
customers, in order to obtain feedback or to validate a final package.</p>
    
    <p class="subtitle">2.	Simplified urls</p>
    <p>Jahia
EE v6.0 is now natively packaged with a new url rewriting system.
Authors have the choice to use url shortcuts (also known as url keys)
or to let the system automatically rewrite Jahia internal urls. This
new sub-system will assist in improving indexation by crawling engines
and will ease page data analysis in various Web Analytics software
products.</p>
    
    <p class="subtitle">3.	Improved system to support multiple renderers or themes</p>
    <p>In
this new release of Jahia, views (e.g: iPhone, RSS ), themes (several
different look and feels for the same template set) and skins (several
combinations of design elements for the same "boxlets”) are now
natively supported, allowing users to easily switch between views,
themes or specific skins according to their devices or layout needs.</p>
    
    <p class="subtitle">4.	Pre-Integrated Support for Google Analytics</p>
    <p>Jahia
EE v6.0 offers native integration with the Google Analytics SaaS
software. In a few clicks, without having to develop or integrate any
lines of code within your template sets, Google Analytics could be
turned on. Managers can then access a dedicated toolbar directly
available on the web page basis in order to view Google Analytics data.
Statistics are available on a per-site or on a per- page basis.
Integration with multi-language web sites allows managers to access
statistics for each configured language. The analytics integration
automatically supports page moving, page renaming or url key
modifications, making sure statistics history is preserved. This
paradigm is also valid when exporting and importing all the content of
a website on a new server environment.</p>
    
<h4 class="subtitle"><u>For Editors:</u></h4>
  <p class="subtitle">1.	Inline editing capabilities</p>
  <p>A
new inline editing feature allows editors to modify content directly
within the page without having to launch any form oriented wizard or
open any new popup window. This feature allows editors to rapidly enter
content on a page with an experience similar to what they are used to
in office tools such as Microsoft Word. For power users this new input
system allows for quick typo edition and other kinds of visual page
formatting without having to loose the context of the current page view
while making their modifications.</p>
    
   <p class="subtitle">2.	Web 2.0 AJAX powered User Interfaces</p>
   <p>Due
to several Enterprise-based contributions Jahia 5 was using several
distinct AJAX technologies (Zimbra, Prototype; Home-grown AJAX
frameworks;…) throughout the whole product. Most of the user interfaces
have been now unified and are leveraging the AJAX Google Web Toolkit
(GWT) framework and are now powered by the powerful and ready to use
Web 2.0 UI components provided by the free open source ExtJS-GWT
components.</p>
   <p>All the new tailor-made Jahia UI components have
been designed with re-use in mind. While Jahia 5 had dozens of
different selectors, pickers or wizards all implementing different
usability paradigms, all these UI components have been unified and
homogenized in Jahia EE v6.0, throughout the entire software. Such components may now also be
used directly within a web page in order to offer advanced dynamic
features to end-users (e.g: the creation of a “Media Gallery template”
may now easily re-use and leverage the existing File Manager UI
component provided by and used in the back-end authoring system). The
introduction of these new UI components has been combined with a visual
revamping of the Jahia authoring interfaces.</p>
    
     <p class="subtitle">3.	Internationalization</p>
   <p>Jahia EE v6 is packaged with 6 languages packs (English, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and German).</p>
   
    <p class="subtitle">4.	Improved integration of the default WYSIWYG editor</p>
   <p>The
embedded Jahia WYSIWYG editor (FCK), which is used by default by
editors in order to create and manage unstructured text elements is now
more deeply integrated with the WCM. New roles allow site
administrators to decide which editors can access to a given FCK
configuration. Files, images and internal links selectors have been
also improved and are now offering strong integration with the back-end
WCM or DMS systems.</p>
   
    <p class="subtitle">5.	Customizable Edition Toolbars</p>
   <p>Inspired
from all existing toolbar desktop systems (Browsers’ toolbars;
Applications’ toolbars;…), Jahia EE v6.0 now comes bundled with a
powerful and customizable toolbar system. The following toolbars are
available:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>the default toolbar (allows access to all the various navigation modes and Jahia sub-systems),<br><br></li>
     <li>a
bookmark and breadcrumb toolbar (a dynamic and multilingual bookmarking
system combined with an integrated page history system),<br><br></li>
     <li>a cache Toolbar (allows access to advanced cache debugging and other cache flushing features),<br><br></li>
     <li>a workflow toolbar (to access shortcuts to widely used workflow features),<br><br></li>
     <li>a Google Analytics toolbar (allows access directly to Google Analytics statistics within the context of the current page). <br><br /></li>
     <li>a Notification toolbar (to subscribe to content update related to the current page)</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Toolbars
can either float on the page or be fixed on the top panel. You can also
completely hide them temporarily. Configurations may be customized on a
user per user basis. Toolbars are also easily customizable by
integrators and will let each customers specify and develop their own
custom toolbars according to their own needs or their own EAI
constraints (e.g: usage of their own analytics system; various
shortcuts to access to their own ERP, CRM or ECM system directly within
Jahia;…).</p>
   <p class="subtitle">6.	Better integrity and consistency checks</p>
<p>The Jahia built-in consistency checks have been optimized. Each kind
of integrity checks (url consistency; WCAG; automated locks for
published binary documents;…) may now be turned on or turned off by the
webmaster on a site-per-site basis. Each consistency check may be now
configured managed on a role-per-role basis to act as a simple warning
which could be bypassed or as a blocking error. Integrity checks have
been also integrated in the new edition toolbars: a custom icon in the
page context allows editors to rapidly identify erroneous content that
requires correction.</p>
 <p class="subtitle">7.	Improved workflow value chain</p>
<p>Jahia EE v6.0 now provides a new enhanced workflow value chain which
includes: a multi-step and multilingual publishing system, a
notification and alerting service, capabilities to queue workflow jobs
on a dedicated processing server, dynamic workflow job reports
personalized by editor as well as an archive of all previously executed
workflow jobs. This new system lets editors and reviewers easily create
workflow batches in order to publish several pages at once. Integrity
checks such as accessibility checks, consistency issues due to
cross-referenced content objects that are still unpublished, or
blocking errors preventing editors from publishing a page due to
missing translations for a mandatory language, are already
pre-integrated and let reviewers rapidly determine content
inter-dependencies.</p>
<p>The in-site editing capabilities provide immediate status views for
all content objects that are waiting for validation. The standard
workflow processes have been improved to simplify the number of
workflow variants and foster collaboration between the different
editing roles involved (editors, reviewers, publishers or translators).
This release also provides a brand new AJAX-powered workflow dashboard
with detailed workflow information. It improves workflow collaboration
throughout the whole workflow value chain by pushing information to the
next reviewers (e.g: using email notification and AJAX alerts if the
user is already logged,…) and by letting them access the archives of
any validation job through an integrated workflow batch reporting
system.</p>
   
   
   <p class="subtitle">8.	Advanced Preview and Advanced Comparison navigation modes</p>
<p>The Advanced Preview mode lets editors choose to preview a page
using another user profile without having to logout from their current
account and of course under the limits of their current permissions.
Such a system also lets them preview the page going back and forward in
time as time-sensitive content may be present within certain pages.
Editors may then better control who will see what and when. The
Advanced Comparison mode allows editors to visually highlight
differences between two dates, not just between the staging and the
published version, as it was the case on Jahia 5. This makes it now
easier to view modifications made on a page in any lapse of time on any
number of versions.</p>

<p class="subtitle">9.	OpenSearch Support</p>
<p>Jahia EE v6.0 now supports the OpenSearch standard both as a
producer (the embedded Jahia search engine is OpenSearch compliant) and
as a consumer (end-user could subscribe to other OpenSearch channels).
End-users may now use any OpenSearch-compliant browser plug-in in order
to make direct quick search in Jahia without needing to first load up
the Jahia-powered site. They may also aggregate third party OpenSearch
channels and embed them into existing Jahia pages.</p>

<h4 class="subtitle"><u>For Developers:</u></h4>
<p class="subtitle">1.	Fully re-factored front-end template infrastructure</p>
<p>One of the main focus points for Jahia EE v6.0 was to fully rewrite
the front-end templating architecture. Jahia EE v6.0 still uses the JSP
framework but improves several points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Content Definitions are now declared in distinct files. This
allows a better separation between views (templates) and content object
definitions. Jahia EE v6.0 now uses the new standardized CND syntax as
specified in the JSR170/283 specification (Java Content API). Jahia
also now implements the brand new standardized Query Object Model
(JSR283 QOM) standard in order to unify search query formats within the
product.<br>
  <br>
</li>
  <li>Support for advanced “mixin types” extensions. These are
similar to “interfaces” in Java, but apply to content object
definitions. Integrators may now easily extend Jahia’s built-in
definitions by using new “mixin types”. For example, Jahia EE v6.0
comes pre-installed with a series of “mixin types” such as
isSearchable, isIndexable; isRSSable, isCommentable;… Additional “mixin
types” may of course be added when needed.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>A
new template inheritance system. In order to better manage
sub-templates, Jahia EE v6.0 is introducing a new JSP object-oriented
inheritance system. This lets template developers inherit from some
core read-only template blocks built by Jahia while overriding and
extending them without having to fork the whole product. Such a system
will ease template reuse, maintenance and migration.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>A
new template deployment system: template sets are now only deployed
once on the server and no more on a per virtual site basis. Such an
improvement will help customers who are using Jahia as a global site
factory and which have created hundreds of distinct virtual sites.
Template modifications may now be automatically shared on all virtual
sites. Of course it is still possible to have separate templates sets
for each virtual site.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> A new fully
re-architectured and re-organized Jahia tag library. The whole sets of
tags provided by default with the previous editions of Jahia were fully
re-factored in order to simplify their usage as well as make them
better citizens with other standard Java tag libraries such as JSTL.<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>Masking
the Jahia back-end complexity. On previous Jahia editions, integrators
and template developers had to completely understand the Jahia data
model in order to start developing a new template set. They had to deal
with correctly modifying the markup for the various edition modes (e.g:
live, preview, compare or edit modes) or to deal with modifying
navigation menus, filters and various status views for logged or
anonymous users, positioning of action menus, etc… All this complexity
is now hidden and is automatically handled by the back-end Jahia
system. Integrators may of course still override the default Jahia
behavior but they do not need to understand the whole Jahia interface
and data model before starting to code.</li>
</ul>
<p class="subtitle">2.	A whole new default templates set</p>
<p>On previous Jahia editions the default template set provided by
Jahia was only aiming to demonstrate some technical capabilities of the
system and was mainly used as a “proof of concept”. Jahia EE v6.0 is
now delivering a ready to use and fully supported set of default
templates. This template set was fully rewritten in order to let
integrators easily customize the product in a couple of hours.</p>
<p>In  order to reach such an objective Jahia Enterprise Edition v6.0 now offers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A new default web design, which may easily be adjusted for most web needs.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>A
100% taglib oriented default template set: all JSP scriptlets and other
code handling directly done within the template set have been removed.
This change will really ease the life of template developers.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
A 100% CSS oriented set of default templates. Web Designers are now
able to generate a new “theme” on top of the existing template set
without having to modify any JSP code. They may simply reuse the
existing features and only focus on adjusting the look and feel of the
site to adjust it to the needed customer brand.</li>
</ul>

<p class="subtitle">3.	TCK / Test Units templates / Jahiapedia</p>
<p>A new set of "Unit Test" templates allows anyone to quickly show
what Jahia is capable of. The combination of those new templates sets
and the Jahiapedia will help integrators and template developers
quickly understand how to develop or extend Jahia templates as well as
being able to browse current template implementations. The new TCK
templates may be also used as best practices in order to boost Jahia
development and integration cycles.</p>

<p class="subtitle">4.	Front-end Cache Simplification</p>
<p>Jahia 5 embedded different front-end HTML caching libraries. Each of
them required learning custom tags and needed an in-depth understanding
of all pros and cons of each cache sub-system. Jahia 5 could also be
used in combination of a homegrown ESI compliant front-end reverse
cache proxy. This caching complexity was requiring a complex learning
curve for integrators and was causing several configuration issues.
Jahia EE v6.0 gets rid of all these problems by natively integrating
and supporting a single unified HTML cache system. The ESI technology
is now fully integrated within the Jahia server. Such a cache is taking
all the advantages of all the previous caching systems and is now
automatically managed by the Jahia back-end system. Template developer
do not have to consider any more which cache system they should use or
how to configure it in their custom templates sets: everything is now
automatically handled by the Jahia system.</p>

<p class="subtitle">5.	Advanced Search Form enhancements</p>
<p>More and more customers are customizing the default Jahia advanced
search form. Such a form was fully reviewed in order to make it more
generic and more customizable. New generic tags let template developers
quickly develop and customize new advanced search forms throughout the
site. Forms may for instance automatically limit the search to binary
files or to WCM published content. The search form tags are integrated
with the new AJAX UI components and let users for example use the user
interface for browsing category trees (in order to refine search
queries by categories) or site trees (in order to refine search queries
according to a sub-site). Advanced search options using metadata are
also supported. These new features open new possibilities to customize
Jahia search options for end-users.</p>

<p class="subtitle">6.	Centralized Notification and Subscription Service</p>
<p>A new centralized and unified notification service is now able to
dispatch messages to various users using multiple transports such as
emails, inline AJAX alerts, SMS, etc. Notification message templates
have also been re-factored so the same layout may be used to send
notifications concerning web pages publications, back-end editing or
workflow messages. These changes make customizations of such
notifications much simpler. Jahia EE v6.0 also introduces a new
subscription service that let users subscribe to content object
modification notifications.</p>

<p class="subtitle">7.	Better handling and personalization of error messages</p>
The error reporting mechanism has been completely re-factored. This includes:
<ul>
  <li>Better management of all HTML errors (403 or 404 error pages;..). Error pages are now customizable for each site.<br>
    <br>
</li>
  <li> New options to automatically hide Java exceptions on
production servers. Template developers can now better handle possible
exceptions in their templates sets. For instance if the rendering a box
in a column fails for any technical reason, Jahia is no longer
displaying such a Java exception directly on the page but catches and
hides it without impacting the end-user navigation.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> Low-level exceptions (console) have also been optimized in order to simplify development<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<a name="anchor_2"></a><h3>Document Management (JSR170 compliant)</h3>
<p>Jahia EE v6.0 replaced Apache Slide, which was previously used for
document management purposes, and embraced the new Apache Jackrabbit,
which is the reference implementation for the "Java Technology Content
Repository API" (JCR API – JSR170). </p>
<p>Thanks to this migration Jahia EE v6.0 benefits from a much more
powerful DMS back-end infrastructure. Our  Document Manager was also
fully rewritten opening the doors to several new features:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Document Management support with options to categorize
files, add metadata, manage permissions, check-in and check-out files
as well as all other standard file operations (copy, paste, delete,
move,…).<br>
  <br>
</li>
    <li>Integrated search engine with saved search functionality.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>Customizable views to ease access to document properties.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>Powerful rules engine based on JBoss JRule in order to automate file actions based on events sent by the DMS.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>Digital
Asset Management: integrated inline image manipulation features
with automated thumbnails generation and a new “media gallery” oriented
view of image directories.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>Full WebDAV access.<br /><br /></li>
    <li>A cross-site shared repository in order to share documents or images with different sites.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>Dedicated public and private spaces for each user.<br><br></li>
    <li>Integrity
checks integrated and heavily coupled with the WCM. For example, files,
which are published on a page, may be automatically locked.<br /><br /></li>
    <li>United
Content Bus connectivity: It allows Jahia’s users to manage and select in their web
projects using one united interface, multiple sources of content such
as business and social applications portlets, widgets, RSS feeds, or document located in Content Repositories, CIFS servers,  
FTP servers and / or proprietary document providers without facing technology and integration challenges. All
those components are considered as Web Content and managed into the
well known simplicity of Jahia’s Web Content Integration user interface
all in Ajax. Considering the Document Management module, proprietary repositories are now supported and allow large
enterprises to browse and select document in various document sources, from Apache Jack Rabbit, CFIS and FTP server to  Alfresco, EMC Documentum,  IBM Lotus Notes, IBM FileNet, Interwoven, Microsoft Sharepoint,
 OpenText, Oracle Stellent, etc...<br />
</li>
</ul>
<a name="anchor_3"></a><h3>Portal Features (JSR168/286 compliant + Mashup support)</h3>
		<br>
		<p class="subtitle">1.	Portal, Portlets and Mashups</p>
		<p>Jahia
EE v6.0 replaced the embedded Apache Jetspeed2 with the Apache Pluto
2.0 library. With this change, Jahia Enterprise Edition v6.0offers
improved support for the latest version of the Portlets standard (<a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr286/index.html" target="_blank">JSR 286</a>). 
		  As Jahia EE v6.0 natively integrates with the Google Web Toolkit (GWT)
		  framework, it can now offer native support to include your own
		  customized GWT widgets within any Jahia page. Jahia EE v6.0 also
		  supports remotely hosted mashups such as Google gadgets, which may now
	  be easily added on any web page.</p>
		<p>Thanks to  Jahia United
		  Content Bus, Jahia’s users manage and select in their web
		  projects, using one united interface, multiple sources of content such
as portlets, widgets, RSS feeds, and document located in Content Repositories, CIFS servers,
FTP servers and / or proprietary document providers without facing technology and integration challenges. All
		  those components are considered as Web Content and managed into the
		  well known simplicity of Jahia’s Web Content Integration user interface
	  all in Ajax. </p>
		<p>Relying on Jahia United Content Bus, Jahia EE v6.0 offers a
		  centralized Mashup Management application in order to help webmasters collect,
		  manage, share and reuse mashups in an easy and intuitive manner. Jahia
		  Enterprise Edition v6.0 unifies the management of portlets
		  (JSR168/JSR286), javascript oriented micro-applications (Google
		  gadgets; netvibes widgets; embedded YouTube videos,...) and content
		  oriented boxlets (native Jahia boxes) into one single federated
		  cross-site repository. Such a tool lets authors easily access the
		  repository of mashups in order to help them populate their pages with
		  rich Web 2.0 applications</p>
	  <p>Finally Jahia EE v6.0 provides a
default "MyPortal" template which offers any logged-in users the
ability to customize their enterprise dashboards with RSS feeds,

			  <li>Support
for portlets instances: a page editor can now reuse an existing portlet
instance on another page. He can also manage categories, permissions or
metadata on each portlet instance.<br>
			    <br>
</li>
	          <li> AJAX powered mashup loading: Mashups present on a
WCM page may now be loaded in an AJAX manner. This lets the user
immediately access the content of the local page while the remotely
hosted mashups (a remote RSS feed or a gadget for example) are loaded
in the background.<br>

New Mashup wizards: Jahia EE v6.0 supports new pre-configured mashup
wizards. Such wizards let power users rapidly create new mashup
instances. The edition currently only includes some basic wizards such
as a RSS wizard or a generic mashup wizard used to access remote web
services. Advanced wizards to connect to other well-known SaaS services
(e.g. GoogleMaps; Slideshare;…) will be developed in the next months.<br>
	            <br>
	          </li>
	          <li>Jahia
provides a new iGoogle-inspired “mashup selector”. Such a selector may
be added on any “MyPortal” kind of page and will let logged-in users
personalize their dashboard in a convenient and easy manner.<br>
