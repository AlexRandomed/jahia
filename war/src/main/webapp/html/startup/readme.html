		<p>Release date: January 28th, 2009</p>

		<p class="style1">Please use Jahia Community Edition v6.0 for test purposes only. Data migration is not ensured. This release is delivered on an as-is manner without any kind of warranties or support from the vendor.</p>
		<p>This ReadMe covers the  release of Jahia Community Edition v6.0. As Enterprise-class software, Jahia Community Edition v6.0 offers a Web Content management  platform combined with some Document Management capabilities and an integrated  Corporate Portal server. Jahia Community Edition v6.0 is now fully leveraging Web 2.0 and Ajax  technologies and is leveraging the most used and state of the art J2EE open  source libraries (Spring; Lucene; Jackrabbit; Pluto; Hibernate;…).</p>
	  <p>This major release aims to ease the life of Jahia  integrators while improving front-end user interfaces with the latest in Web  2.0 technologies. Jahia Community Edition v6.0 user interfaces have been fully redesigned and  improved by integrating native support for the AJAX Google Web Toolkit (GWT)  library and the rich Ext GWT components (<a href="http://www.extjs.com/products/gxt/">http://www.extjs.com/products/gxt/</a>).  All our front-end templating technologies have also been rewritten to offer a  cleaner integrator story (clearer separation of content definitions and views;  complete refactoring of all the old Jahia taglibs; migration to a full CSS  support; better support for skins and themes;…) and our embedded document and  portal servers were upgraded to the latest versions of the existing standards  (support for JSR170, JSR168 and JSR 286).</p>
		<p>Jahia Community Edition v6.0 is also now fully available under the most  common FOSS license, the GNU General Public License (GPL) which is approved by  the Open Source Initiative (OSI). Jahia provides its software under a dual  license model designed to meet the development and distribution needs of both  commercial and FOSS projects. More information about Jahia licensing is  available on the following link: <a href="http://www.jahia.com/jahia/products/licenses.html">http://www.jahia.com/jahia/products/licenses.html</a></p>

  <h3>Enterprise Web Content Management Syste</h3>
  <h4 class="subtitle"><u>For Managers:</u></h4>
  <p class="subtitle">Ready-to-use starter kits</p>
<p>While Jahia 5.0 was  pre-packaged with some “proof-of-concept” default templates, Jahia Community Edition v6.0 now  includes some ready-to-use Starter Kits.</p>
<p> This first  edition is  focusing on a demonstration package targeted to brochure-ware public web sites.  Additional “Starter Kits” will be made available during the next months in  order to significantly shorten integration time required to go from concept to  production. Such Starter Kits will focus on different target needs (Brochure-ware  Public Web Sites or Collaborative Intranets) or on vertical industries needs (eGovernment,  Education, Insurance, Bank…).</p>
<p>The Jahia installation  process was also improved in order to let managers directly test some  pre-configured demonstration packages. Integrators can now use this feature to  provide “pre-configured test builds” with pre-populated content to their  customers, in order to obtain feedback or to validate a final package.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Simplified urls</p>

<p>Jahia Community Edition v6.0 is now natively  packaged with a new url rewriting system. Authors have the choice to use  url shortcuts (also known as url keys) or to  let the system automatically rewrite Jahia internal urls. This new sub-system  will assist in improving indexation by crawling engines and will ease page data  analysis in various Web Analytics software products.</p>

	  <p class="subtitle">Improved system to support multiple renderers or themes</p>
				<p>In this new release of Jahia, views (e.g: iPhone, RSS  ), themes (several different look and feels for the same template set) and skins  (several combinations of design elements for the same &quot;boxlets”) are now  natively supported, allowing users to easily switch between views, themes or  specific skins according to their devices or layout needs.</p>
				<p class="subtitle">Pre-Integrated Support for Google Analytics</p>
<p>Jahia Community Edition v6.0 offers native integration with the Google  Analytics SaaS software. In a few clicks, without having to develop or  integrate any lines of code within your template sets, Google Analytics could  be turned on. Managers can then access a dedicated toolbar directly available  on the web page basis in order to view Google Analytics data. Statistics are  available on a per-site or on a per- page basis. Integration with multi-language  web sites allows managers to access statistics for each configured language.  The analytics integration automatically supports page moving, page renaming or  url key modifications, making sure statistics history is preserved.. This  paradigm is also valid when exporting and importing all the content of a website  on a new server environment.</p>
  <h4 class="subtitle"><u>For Editors:</u></h4>
  <p class="subtitle">Inline editing capabilities</p>
  <p>A new inline editing feature allows editors to modify  content directly within the page without having to launch any form oriented  wizard or open any new popup window. This feature allows editors to rapidly  enter content on a page with an experience similar to what they are used to in  office tools such as Microsoft Word. For power users this new input system  allows for quick typo edition and other kinds of visual page formatting without  having to loose the context of the current page view while making their  modifications.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Web 2.0 AJAX powered User Interfaces</p>

<p>Due to several community-based contributions Jahia 5  was using several distinct AJAX technologies (Zimbra, Prototype; Home-grown  AJAX frameworks;…) throughout the whole product. Most of the user interfaces  have been now unified and are leveraging the AJAX Google Web Toolkit (GWT)  framework and are now powered by the powerful and ready to use Web 2.0 UI  components provided by the free open source ExtJS-GWT components.</p>
<p>All the new tailor-made Jahia UI components have been  designed with re-use in mind. While Jahia 5 had dozens of different selectors,  pickers or wizards all implementing different usability paradigms, all these UI  components have been unified and homogenized throughout the product. Such components  may now also be used directly within a web page in order to offer advanced  dynamic features to end-users (e.g: the creation of a “Media Gallery template” may  now easily re-use and leverage the existing File Manager UI component provided by  and used in the back-end authoring system).</p>
<p>The introduction of these new UI components has been  combined with a visual revamping of the Jahia authoring interfaces.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Internationalization</p>
<p>The  release is currently only packaged with 3  language packs (English, French and German). The final edition will support 6  languages with the addition of Italian, Spanish and Portuguese. Additional  optional template packs maintained by the Jahia community will be soon  available on our Jahia Community Web Site (www.jahia.org).</p>
<p class="subtitle">Improved integration of the default WYSIWYG editor</p>
<p>The embedded Jahia WYSIWYG editor (FCK), which is  used by default by editors in order to create and manage unstructured text  elements is now more deeply integrated with the WCM. New roles allow site  administrators to decide which editors can access a given FCK configuration.  Files, images and internal links selectors have also been improved and are now  offering strong integration with the back-end WCM or DMS systems.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Customizable Edition Toolbars</p>
<p>Inspired from all existing toolbar desktop systems  (Browsers’ toolbars; Applications’ toolbars;…), Jahia Community Edition v6.0 now comes bundled with a  powerful and customizable toolbar system. The following toolbars are available  in Jahia Community Edition v6.0’s package :</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>the default toolbar (allows access to all the       various navigation modes and Jahia sub-systems)<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>a bookmark and breadcrumb toolbar (a dynamic and       multilingual bookmarking system combined with an integrated page history       system) <br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>a cache Toolbar (aimed at developers and webmasters       allowing access to advanced cache debugging and other cache flushing       features) <br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>a workflow toolbar (to access shortcuts to widely       used workflow features) <br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>a Google Analytics toolbar (allows access directly       to Google Analytics statistics within the context of the current page)</li>
</ul>
<p>Toolbars can either float on the page or be fixed on  the top panel. You can also completely hide them temporarily. Configurations may  be customized on a user per user basis. Toolbars are also easily customizable  by integrators and will let each customers specify and develop their own custom  toolbars according to their own needs or their own EAI constraints (e.g: usage  of their own analytics system; various shortcuts to access to their own ERP,  CRM or ECM system directly within Jahia;…).</p>
<p class="subtitle">Better integrity and consistency checks</p>
<p>The Jahia built-in consistency checks have been  optimized. Each kind of integrity checks (url consistency; WCAG; automated  locks for published binary documents;…) may now be turned on or off by the  webmaster on a site-per-site basis. Each consistency check may be now  configured  managed on a role-per-role  basis to act as a simple warning which could be bypassed or as a blocking  error. Integrity checks have been also integrated in the new edition toolbars: a  custom icon in the page context allows editors to rapidly identify erroneous  content which requires correction.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Improved workflow value chain</p>
<p>Jahia Community Edition v6.0 now provides a new enhanced workflow value  chain which includes : a multi-step and multilingual publishing system, a  notification and alerting service, capabilities to queue workflow jobs on a  dedicated processing server, dynamic workflow job reports personalized by  editor as well as an archive of all previously executed workflow jobs. </p>
<p>This new system lets editors and reviewers easily  create workflow batches in order to publish several pages at once. Integrity  checks such as accessibility checks, consistency issues due to cross-referenced  content objects that are still unpublished, or blocking errors preventing editors  from publishing a page due to missing translations for a mandatory language,  are already pre-integrated and let reviewers rapidly determine content inter-dependencies.</p>
<p>The in-site editing capabilities provide immediate  status views for all content objects which are waiting for validation. The  standard workflow processes have been improved to simplify the number of  workflow variants and foster collaboration between the different editing roles  involved (editors, reviewers, publishers or translators).</p>
<p>This release also provides a brand new AJAX-powered  workflow dashboard with detailed workflow information. It improves workflow  collaboration throughout the whole workflow value chain by pushing information  to the next reviewers (e.g: using email notification and AJAX alerts if the  user is already logged,…) and by letting them access the archives of any  validation job through an integrated workflow batch reporting system.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Advanced Preview and Advanced Comparison navigation modes</p>
<p>The Advanced Preview mode lets editors choose to  preview a page using another user profile without having to logout from their  current account and of course under the limits of their current permissions.  Such a system also lets them preview the page going back and forward in time as  time-sensitive content may be present within certain pages. Editors may then  better control who will see what and when.</p>
<p> The Advanced Comparison mode allows editors to  visually highlight differences between any two dates, not just between the  staging and the published version, as it was the case on Jahia 5. This makes it  now easier to view modifications made on a page in any lapse of time on any  number of versions. </p>
<p class="subtitle">OpenSearch Support</p>
<p>Jahia Community Edition v6.0 now supports the OpenSearch standard both as  a producer (the embedded Jahia search engine is OpenSearch compliant) and as a  consumer (end-user could subscribe to other OpenSearch channels). End-users may  now use any OpenSearch-compliant browser plug-in in order to make direct quick  search in Jahia without needing to first load up the Jahia-powered site. They  may also aggregate third party OpenSearch channels and embed them into existing  Jahia pages.</p>
<h4 class="subtitle"><u>For Developers:</u></h4>
<p class="subtitle">Fully re-factored front-end template infrastructure</p>
<p>One of the main focus points for Jahia Community Edition v6.0 was to fully  rewrite the front-end templating architecture. Jahia Community Edition v6.0 still uses the JSP  framework but improves several points:</p>

<ul><li>Content Definitions are now declared in distinct  files. This allows a better separation between views (templates) and content  object definitions. Jahia Community Edition v6.0 now uses the new standardized CND syntax as  specified in the JSR170/283 specification (Java Content API). Jahia also now  implements the brand new standardized Query Object Model (JSR283 QOM) standard in  order to unify search query formats within the product.<br />
  <br />
</li>
  <li>Support for advanced “mixin types” extensions. These  are similar to “interfaces” in Java, but apply to content object definitions. Integrators  may now easily extend Jahia’s built-in definitions by using new “mixin types”.  For example, Jahia Community Edition v6.0 comes pre-installed with a series of “mixin types” such as  isSearchable, isIndexable; isRSSable, isCommentable;… Additional “mixin types” may  of course be added when needed.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>A new template inheritance system. In order to better  manage sub-templates, Jahia Community Edition v6.0 is introducing a new JSP object-oriented  inheritance system. This lets template developers inherit from some core  read-only template blocks built by Jahia while overriding and extending them  without having to fork the whole product. Such a system will ease template  reuse, maintenance and migration.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>A new template deployment system: template sets are  now only deployed once on the server and no more on a per virtual site basis.  Such an improvement will help customers who are using Jahia as a global site  factory and which have created hundreds of distinct virtual sites. Template  modifications may now be automatically shared on all virtual sites. Of course  it is still possible to have separate templates sets for each virtual site.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>A new fully re-architectured and re-organized Jahia  tag library. The whole sets of tags provided by default with the previous  editions of Jahia were fully re-factored in order to simplify their usage as  well as make them better citizens with other standard Java tag libraries such  as JSTL.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Masking the Jahia back-end complexity. On previous  Jahia editions, integrators and template developers had to completely  understand the Jahia data model in order to start developing a new template  set. They had to deal with correctly modifiying the markup for the various  edition modes (e.g: live, preview, compare or edit modes) or to deal with  modifying navigation menus, filters and various  status views for logged or anonymous users, positioning of action menus, etc…  All this complexity is now hidden and is automatically handled by the back-end Jahia  system. Integrators may of course still override the default Jahia behavior but  they do not need to understand the whole Jahia interface and data model before  starting to code.</li>
</ul>
<p class="subtitle">A whole new default templates set</p>
<p>On previous Jahia editions the default template set  provided by Jahia was only aiming to demonstrate some technical capabilities of  the system and was mainly used as a “proof of concept”. Jahia Community Edition v6.0 is now  delivering a ready to use and fully supported set of default templates.</p>
<p>This template set was fully rewritten in order to let  integrators easily customize the product in a couple of hours.</p>
<p>In order to reach such an objective Jahia Community Edition v6.0 now  offers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A new default web design, which may easily be  adjusted for most web needs.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>A 100% taglib oriented default template set: all JSP  scriptlets and other code handling directly done within the template set have  been removed. This change will really ease the life of template developers.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>A 100% CSS oriented set of default templates. Web  Designers are now able to generate a new “theme” on top of the existing  template set without having to modify any JSP code. They may simply reuse the  existing features and only focus on adjusting the look and feel of the site to  adjust it to the needed customer brand.</li>
</ul>
<p class="subtitle">TCK / Test Units templates / Jahiapedia</p>
<p>A new set of &quot;Unit Test&quot; templates allows  anyone to quickly show what Jahia is capable of. These templates are  cross-referenced with the new Jahiapedia section, which is part of the new  Jahia open source-driven community web site (accessible at  http://www.jahia.org).</p>
<p> The combination of those new templates sets and the  Jahiapedia will help integrators and template developers quickly understand how  to develop or extend Jahia templates as well as being able to browse current  template implementations. The new TCK templates may be also used as best  practices in order to boost Jahia development and integration cycles.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Front-end Cache  Simplification</p>
<p>Jahia 5 embedded different front-end HTML caching  libraries. Each of them required learning custom tags and needed an in-depth  understanding of all pros and cons of each cache sub-system. Jahia 5 could also  be used in combination of a homegrown ESI compliant front-end reverse cache  proxy. This caching complexity was requiring a complex learning curve for  integrators and was causing several configuration issues. </p>
<p>Jahia Community Edition v6.0 gets rid of all these problems by natively  integrating and supporting a single unified HTML cache system. The ESI  technology is now fully integrated within the Jahia server. Such a cache is  taking all the advantages of all the previous caching systems and is now automatically  managed by the Jahia back-end system. Template developer do not have to  consider any more which cache system they should use or how to configure it in  their custom templates sets: everything is now automatically handled by the Jahia  system.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Advanced Search Form enhancements</p>
<p>More and more customers are customizing the default Jahia  advanced search form. Such a form was fully reviewed in order to make it more  generic and more customizable. New generic tags let  template developers quickly develop and  customize new advanced search forms throughout the site. Forms may for instance  automatically limit the search to binary files or to WCM published content. The  search form tags are integrated with the new AJAX UI components and let users for  example use the user interface for browsing category trees (in order to refine  search queries by categories) or site trees (in order to refine search queries  according to a sub-site). Advanced search options using metadata are also  supported. These new features open new possibilities to customize Jahia search  options for end-users.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Centralized Notification and Subscription Service</p>
<p>A new centralized and unified notification service is  now able to dispatch messages to various users using multiple transports such  as emails, inline AJAX alerts, SMS, etc. Notification message templates have also  been re-factored so the same layout may be used to send notifications concerning  web pages publications, back-end editing or workflow messages. These changes  make customizations of such notifications much simpler. Jahia Community Edition v6.0 also introduces  a new subscription service that let users subscribe to content object  modification notifications.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Better handling and personalization of error messages</p>
The error reporting mechanism has been completely re-factored. This includes:
<ul>
  <li>Better management of all HTML errors (403 or 404 error pages;..). Error pages are now customizable for each site.<br />
    <br />
</li>
  <li>    New options to automatically hide Java exceptions on production servers. Template developers can now better handle possible exceptions in their templates sets. For instance if the rendering a box in a column fails for any technical reason, Jahia is no longer displaying such a Java exception directly on the page but catches and hides it without impacting the end-user navigation.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li> Low-level exceptions (console) have also been optimized in order to simplify development<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Document Management System (JSR170 compliant)</h3>
<p>Jahia Community Edition v6.0 replaced Apache Slide, which was previously  used for document management purposes, and embraced the new Apache Jackrabbit,  which is the reference implementation for the &quot;Java Technology Content  Repository API&quot; (JCR API – JSR170). </p>
<p>Thanks to this migration Jahia Community Edition v6.0 benefits from a  much more powerful DMS back-end infrastructure. Our old Document Manager was  also fully rewritten opening the doors to several new features: </p>
<ul><li>Document Management support with options to  categorize files, add metadata, manage permissions, check-in and check-out  files as well as all other standard file operations (copy, paste, delete,  move,…)<br />
  <br />
</li>
    <li>Integrated search engine with saved search  functionality <br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Customizable views to ease access to document  properties<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Powerful rules engine based on JBoss JRule in order  to automate file actions based on  events  sent by the DMS<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Digital Asset Management (DAM): integrated inline  image manipulation features with automated thumbnails generation and a new “media  gallery” oriented view of image directories<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Full WebDAV access<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>External connectors in order to mount other third  party document management systems. Jahia Community Edition v6.0 provides by default a CIFS/SMB (aka  Windows Network File Sharing) connector. Additional connectors could be  integrated as needed.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>A cross-site shared repository in order to share  documents or images with different sites.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Dedicated public and private spaces for each user.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Integrity checks integrated and heavily coupled with  the WCM. For example, files which are published on a page may be automatically  locked</li>
  </ul>


		<h3>Corporate Portal Server (JSR168/286 compliant  + Mashup support)</h3>
		<br />


	    <p>Portal, Portlets and Mashups
		</p>
	    <p>Jahia Community Edition v6.0 replaced the embedded Apache Jetspeed2 with  the Apache Pluto 2.0 library. With this change, Jahia Community Edition v6.0offers  improved support for the latest version of the Portlets standard (<a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr286/index.html">JSR  286</a>). As Jahia Community Edition v6.0 natively integrates with the Google Web Toolkit (GWT)  framework, it can now offer native support to include your own customized GWT  widgets within any Jahia page. Jahia Community Edition v6.0 also supports remotely hosted mashups  such as Google gadgets, which may now be easily added on any web page.</p>
			<p>Jahia Community Edition v6.0 offers a Centralized Mashup Repository in  order to help webmasters collect, manage, share and reuse mashups in an easy  and intuitive manner. Jahia Community Edition v6.0 unifies the management of portlets  (JSR168/JSR286), javascript oriented micro-applications (Google gadgets;  netvibes widgets; embedded YouTube videos,...) and content oriented boxlets  (native Jahia boxes) into one single federated cross-site repository. Such a  tool lets authors easily access the repository of mashups in order to help them  populate their pages with rich Web 2.0 applications</p>
			<p>Finally Jahia Community Edition v6.0 provides a default &quot;MyPortal&quot;  template which offers any logged-in users the ability to customize their  enterprise dashboards with RSS feeds, podcasts, events or specific content in  relation with their daily business. </p>
			<p class="subtitle">Advanced Portal features include:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Support for portlets instances: a page editor can now reuse an existing portlet instance on another page. He can also manage categories, permissions or metadata on each portlet instance.<br />
			    <br />
</li>
	          <li>		        AJAX powered mashup loading: Mashups present on a WCM page may now be loaded in an AJAX manner. This lets the user immediately access the content of the local page while the remotely hosted mashups (a remote RSS feed or a gadget for example) are loaded in the background.<br />
	            <br />
	          </li>
	          <li>Introduction of a new Preference API: user preferences, portlets or mashup positions, user customizations of editing toolbars,... are now stored in a new JCR-backed Preference API. New user preferences may be added by any integrators in order to extend personalization.<br />
	            <br />
	          </li>
	          <li> New Mashup wizards: Jahia Community Edition v6.0 supports new pre-configured mashup wizards. Such wizards let power users rapidly create new mashup instances. The  edition currently only includes some basic wizards such as a RSS wizard or a generic mashup wizard used to access remote web services. Advanced wizards to connect to other well-known SaaS services (e.g. GoogleMaps; Slideshare;…) will be developed in the next months.<br />
	            <br />
	          </li>
	          <li>Jahia provides a new iGoogle-inspired “mashup selector”. Such a selector may be added on any “MyPortal” kind of page and will let logged-in users personalize their dashboard in a convenient and easy manner.<br />
              </li>
