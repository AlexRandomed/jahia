Sometimes it is useful to include the contents of descendant nodes into a single node to easier search on content that is scattered across multiple nodes.
Jackrabbit allows you to define index aggregates based on relative path patterns and primary node types.
The following example creates an index aggregate on nt:file that includes the content of the jcr:content node:
    -->
    <!--
    <aggregate primaryType="nt:file">
        <include primaryType="nt:resource">*</include>
    </aggregate>
    -->

</configuration>
